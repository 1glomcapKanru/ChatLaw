- If the navigation does not work or is inaccurate, make sure that you have inserted a valid SD card with map data into the slot. Also check that you have selected the correct country and region for navigation. You can update your map data by buying a new SD card from your Volkswagen dealer or online.
- If the radio reception is poor or noisy, make sure that you have selected a strong station and that your antenna is properly connected. You can also try changing the frequency manually or using the scan function to find a better station.
- If your phone does not connect or function properly via Bluetooth, make sure that your phone is compatible with the RNS 310 and that it is paired and connected correctly. You can also try deleting and re-pairing your phone or resetting your phone's Bluetooth settings.
