Dead Island Save Editor Premium (DISEP) is a small editor that allows you to repair save games created with the Dead Island Save Editor (DISE) script. DISE is a powerful tool that allows you to modify your save-files and get access to various features and improvements[^2^] [^3^]. However, some older versions of DISE may cause corruption or invalid file sizes in your save games. DISEP was created to allow you to fix these issues and make your save games compatible with the current versions of DISE[^2^].

DISEP requires the MMED addon to be able to use. MMED is a mod manager and editor for Minecraft that allows you to create and edit save files for various games, including Dead Island[^2^]. If you're running a version of Minecraft that doesn't support the MMED addon, you can still use DISEP by changing the first line of the script to: --no-input.
 
To use DISEP, simply load the save game that you want to fix and right-click the save file. Select Open with Dead Island Save Editor Premium, then click on OK to proceed. DISEP has two main functions: repair and resize. Repair will fix save games that are marked as having corruption, while resize will fix save games that have invalid file sizes. Note that DISEP does not fix save games that are actually corrupt, or save games that are not even marked as corrupt. If you have a save game that DISEP doesn't support, make sure to use MMED to create a new save game from the save file.
 
To repair a save game, simply type --repair and the name of the save file. For example, to repair the save file world\_2.bin, you would type: --repair world\_2.bin. To resize a save game, simply type --resize and the name of the save file. For example, to resize the save file world\_3.bin, you would type: --resize world\_3.bin. DISEP will then perform the necessary actions and create a new save file with the same name but with a .fixed extension. For example, world\_2.bin.fixed or world\_3.bin.fixed. You can then load these new save files with DISE or MMED and enjoy your game.
