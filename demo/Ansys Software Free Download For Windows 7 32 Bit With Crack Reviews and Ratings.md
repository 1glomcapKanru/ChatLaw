## Example 1: Static Structural Analysis of a Beam
 
In this example, we will perform a static structural analysis of a beam subjected to a uniform load. We will use Ansys Mechanical to create the model, apply the load and boundary conditions, and obtain the stress and displacement results.

1. Launch Ansys Workbench from your desktop or start menu and create a new project.
2. Drag and drop the "Static Structural" analysis system from the toolbox to the project schematic.
3. Double-click on the "Geometry" cell to open Ansys DesignModeler. Here you can create or import your geometry for the analysis.
4. In the sketching mode, draw a rectangle with dimensions 1 m x 0.1 m. This will be the cross-section of the beam.
5. Exit the sketching mode and extrude the rectangle by 5 m along the X-axis. This will create the beam geometry.
6. Save and close Ansys DesignModeler. The geometry will be automatically transferred to Ansys Mechanical.
7. Double-click on the "Model" cell to open Ansys Mechanical. Here you can define the material properties, mesh, loads and boundary conditions for the analysis.
8. In the outline tree, right-click on "Engineering Data" and select "Add Engineering Data". A new window will open where you can select or define the material for the beam. For this example, we will use Steel as the material.
9. In the outline tree, right-click on "Mesh" and select "Generate Mesh". A mesh will be created for the beam geometry. You can adjust the mesh settings if needed.
10. In the outline tree, expand the "Static Structural" branch and right-click on "Supports". Select "Fixed Support" from the menu. A fixed support will be applied to one end of the beam (Face A).
11. Right-click on "Loads" and select "Pressure" from the menu. A pressure load will be applied to the top face of the beam (Face B). Enter a value of -10 kPa for the pressure magnitude. This represents a uniform downward load on the beam.
12. Click on "Solve" in the toolbar to run the analysis. The solver will calculate the stress and displacement results for the beam.
13. Click on "Solution" in the outline tree to view the results. You can select different result items from the menu, such as "Equivalent Stress", "Total Deformation", etc. You can also create plots, charts and animations of the results.

The following figures show some of the results obtained from this example:
