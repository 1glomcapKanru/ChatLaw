What is EAX and why is it important for games?

EAX was developed by Creative Technology, the company behind the Sound Blaster sound cards, and it is supported by many game engines and platforms, such as DirectX, OpenAL, and PlayStation.

- Reverberation: This effect simulates how sound waves bounce off walls, floors, ceilings, and other surfaces in a room or an outdoor space. It creates a sense of depth and space for the sound.
- Occlusion: This effect simulates how sound waves are blocked or reduced by obstacles in the line of sight between the listener and the sound source. It creates a sense of realism and immersion for the sound.
- Obstruction: This effect simulates how sound waves are distorted or filtered by objects that partially block the path between the listener and the sound source. It creates a sense of directionality and distance for the sound.
- Environmental presets: These are predefined settings that apply a combination of reverberation, occlusion, obstruction, and other effects to create different types of environments, such as caves, forests, arenas, cathedrals, etc. They create a sense of atmosphere and mood for the sound.

EAX can make a game sound more realistic and immersive by creating a dynamic and interactive audio environment that responds to the actions and movements of the player and the game characters. For example, in Far Cry 2, EAX can make you hear the echoes of your gunshots in a cave, the muffled sounds of enemies behind a wall, the changes in sound quality when you enter or exit a building, and the different ambient sounds of different locations in Africa.
