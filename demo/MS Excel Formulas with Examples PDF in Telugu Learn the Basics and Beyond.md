## How to Use Excel Formulas in Telugu
 
Excel formulas are expressions that perform calculations on values in a worksheet. You can use formulas to perform simple operations like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers, or more complex operations like finding the average, maximum, minimum, or count of a range of cells. You can also use formulas to refer to other cells, worksheets, or workbooks, and to perform logical tests and return different results based on the outcome.
 
To use Excel formulas in Telugu, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the cell where you want to enter the formula.
2. Type an equal sign (=) to start the formula.
3. Type the name of the function you want to use in English or Telugu. For example, if you want to use the SUM function to add up a range of cells, you can type =SUM or =à°¸à°à°à°²à°¨à°.
4. Type an opening parenthesis (() after the function name.
5. Type the arguments for the function, separated by commas. Arguments are the values or cell references that the function uses to perform the calculation. For example, if you want to add up the values in cells A1 through A10, you can type =SUM(A1:A10) or =à°¸à°à°à°²à°¨à°(A1:A10).
6. Type a closing parenthesis ()) after the last argument.
7. Press Enter or Tab to complete the formula and see the result in the cell.

You can also use the Formula Builder pane to help you create and edit formulas. To open the Formula Builder pane, click on the fx button on the Formula tab in the Ribbon. The Formula Builder pane will show you a list of functions in English and Telugu, along with their descriptions and syntax. You can select a function from the list and see its arguments and examples. You can also type a function name or part of it in the Search box and see matching functions. To insert a function into your formula, double-click on it or click on OK.
