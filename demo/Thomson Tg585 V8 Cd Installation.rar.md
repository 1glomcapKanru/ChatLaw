## Step 4: Connect Your Router
 
Once the installation is done, you can connect your router to your computer using an Ethernet cable. Plug one end of the cable into one of the LAN ports on the back of your router and the other end into your computer's Ethernet port. You should see a green light on both devices indicating that they are connected.

Click on **Login** to enter your router's settings.
 
## Step 6: Configure Your Router
 
Now that you have access to your router's settings, you can configure it according to your preferences and needs. You can change the network name (SSID), password, security mode, firewall settings, port forwarding, parental controls, and more. You can also update your router's firmware if there is a newer version available.
