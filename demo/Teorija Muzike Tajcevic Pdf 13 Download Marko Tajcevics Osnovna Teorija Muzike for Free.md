One of the main features of Tajcevic's music theory is his use of the modal system, which he derived from the folk music of the Balkans. He classified the modes into four groups: major, minor, harmonic, and melodic. He also developed a method of transposition and modulation based on the modal degrees and the circle of fifths. He applied his modal theory to both tonal and atonal music, and he showed how it can enrich the musical expression and diversity.
 
Another important aspect of Tajcevic's music theory is his analysis of musical form. He divided the form into three levels: macroform, mesoform, and microform. Macroform refers to the overall structure of a piece, such as sonata, rondo, or variation. Mesoform refers to the intermediate sections of a piece, such as exposition, development, or recapitulation. Microform refers to the smallest units of a piece, such as motive, phrase, or period. He explained how these levels are related and how they create coherence and contrast in music.
 
Tajcevic's music theory is not only a theoretical system, but also a practical guide for composers and performers. He demonstrated how his theory can be used to create original compositions and arrangements, as well as to interpret and appreciate existing works. He also encouraged his students and readers to experiment with different modes, forms, and techniques, and to develop their own musical style and personality.
