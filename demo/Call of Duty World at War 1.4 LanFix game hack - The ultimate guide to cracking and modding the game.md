- Communicate with your teammates. Use voice chat or text chat to coordinate your actions, share information, and warn each other of dangers.
- Stick together. Don't wander off alone or split up too much. You will be more vulnerable to enemy attacks and less able to revive each other.
- Share resources. Don't hog all the ammo, weapons, or perks. Share them with your teammates and help each other out.
- Use cover. Don't expose yourself too much to enemy fire. Use walls, crates, or other objects to protect yourself and shoot from behind.
