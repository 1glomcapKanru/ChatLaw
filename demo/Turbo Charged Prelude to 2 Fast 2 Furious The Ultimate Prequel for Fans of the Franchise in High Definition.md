If you are a fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, you probably know that the second movie, 2 Fast 2 Furious, starts with Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) racing in Miami with a green Nissan Skyline GT-R R34. But how did he get there from Los Angeles, where he let Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) escape at the end of the first movie?
  
The answer is in a short film called Turbo Charged Prelude to 2 Fast 2 Furious, which was released on DVD as a bonus feature before the second movie hit theaters in 2003. Directed by Philip G. Atwell and written by Keith Dinielli, the six-minute film follows Brian as he flees from the law across the country, winning street races and money along the way.

The film features no dialogue, except for some news reports and police radio chatter. It also features cameo appearances by Peter Aylward and Rodney Neil as police officers, Minka Kelly as a woman who gives Brian a ride to San Antonio, and Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto in archival footage from the first movie.
  
The film shows Brian driving a 1991 Dodge Stealth in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, before ditching it at a motel when the cops catch up with him. He then buys a Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 from a used car lot and modifies it with new parts and paint. He continues his journey eastward, racing against various cars, including a Ferrari 360 Spider. He finally arrives in Miami, where he sees a Toyota Supra and a Mazda RX-7 before the screen reads "2 be continued..."
  
Turbo Charged Prelude to 2 Fast 2 Furious is a fun and exciting way to bridge the gap between the first and second movies of the franchise. It also showcases Paul Walker's charisma and passion for cars, which made him a beloved star of the series. If you haven't seen it yet, you can find it on YouTube or on special edition DVDs of The Fast and the Furious.
  
But what happens next? How does Brian get involved with the Miami street racing scene and meet his old friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson)? How does he end up working for the FBI again and going undercover to bust a drug lord named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser)? And what about the mysterious woman named Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes), who is also an undercover agent and Verone's girlfriend?
