If you have a Minolta Di1610 printer and want to use it on your Windows 7 64-bit computer, you may encounter some difficulties finding and installing the right driver. The Minolta Di1610 driver is not compatible with Windows 7 64-bit by default, and you need to use a workaround to make it work. In this article, we will show you how to install the Minolta Di1610 driver on Windows 7 64-bit in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download the Minolta Di1610 Driver
 
The first step is to download the Minolta Di1610 driver from the official website of Konica Minolta, the manufacturer of the printer. You can find the driver here: [https://www.konicaminolta.eu/en/business-solutions/support/download-center.html](https://www.konicaminolta.eu/en/business-solutions/support/download-center.html). Enter "Di1610" in the search box and select your operating system as "Windows Vista (x64)". Then click on "Search" and download the file named "Di1610 GDI Printer Driver".

## Step 2: Extract the Minolta Di1610 Driver
 
The next step is to extract the Minolta Di1610 driver from the downloaded file. The file is a ZIP archive that contains several files and folders. You need to extract them to a folder on your computer. You can use any software that can open ZIP files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. Right-click on the file and choose "Extract Here" or "Extract to Di1610\_GDI\_Printer\_Driver". You will see a folder named "Di1610\_GDI\_Printer\_Driver" with several subfolders inside.
 
## Step 3: Modify the Minolta Di1610 Driver
 
The third step is to modify the Minolta Di1610 driver to make it compatible with Windows 7 64-bit. You need to edit a file named "oemsetup.inf" that is located in the folder "Di1610\_GDI\_Printer\_Driver\English". You can use any text editor, such as Notepad or WordPad. Open the file and look for the following lines:

    [Manufacturer]
    %MINOLTA%=MINOLTA
    
    [MINOLTA]
    %MINOLTA_Di1610%=MINOLTA_Di1610,GDI_MINOLTA_Di1610

You need to change them to:

    [Manufacturer]
    %MINOLTA%=MINOLTA
    
    [MINOLTA.NTamd64]
    %MINOLTA_Di1610%=MINOLTA_Di1610,GDI_MINOLTA_Di1610

This will tell Windows that the driver is for 64-bit systems. Save the file and close it.
 
## Step 4: Install the Minolta Di1610 Driver
 
The final step is to install the Minolta Di1610 driver on your Windows 7 64-bit computer. You need to connect your printer to your computer via USB cable and turn it on. Then go to Control Panel > Devices and Printers > Add a Printer > Add a Local Printer > Use an Existing Port > USB001 (Virtual Printer Port for USB) > Next > Have Disk > Browse > Select the folder "Di1610\_GDI\_Printer\_Driver\English" > Open > OK > Select "Minolta Di1610" from the list > Next > Follow the instructions on the screen > Finish.
