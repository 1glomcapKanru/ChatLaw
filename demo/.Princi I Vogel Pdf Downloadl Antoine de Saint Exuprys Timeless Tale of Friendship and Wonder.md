If you are looking for a powerful and versatile IDE for C and C++ development, you might want to check out JetBrains CLion 2019.1. This cross-platform IDE offers a range of features that can help you write code faster, smarter, and cleaner. In this article, we will review some of the main benefits of using CLion 2019.1 for your C and C++ projects.
 
## Smart C and C++ Editor
 
One of the most important aspects of any IDE is the code editor. CLion 2019.1 provides a smart editor that deeply understands C and C++ syntax and semantics. It offers code completion, navigation, refactoring, formatting, and more. Here are some examples of how CLion 2019.1 can help you write code effectively:

- Smart Completion: CLion 2019.1 can filter completion results by type, so you can quickly find the most relevant suggestions.
- Breadcrumbs: CLion 2019.1 can show you your location inside the hierarchy of scopes, so you can easily navigate through complex code structures.
- Parameter Name Hints: CLion 2019.1 can display the names of function parameters inline, so you can understand the meaning of each argument.
- Code Generation: CLion 2019.1 can generate tons of boilerplate code for you, such as constructors, destructors, getters, setters, operators, and more.
- Safe Refactoring: CLion 2019.1 can perform automated refactoring operations on your code, such as rename, inline, move, change signature, extract, and more. It will also propagate the changes throughout your code base safely.
- Quick Documentation: CLion 2019.1 can show you detailed information about any symbol under the caret, such as function signatures, comments, documentation, inferred types, macro replacements, and more.

## Code Analysis on the Fly
 
Another key feature of any IDE is the code analysis. CLion 2019.1 can detect and fix potential code issues as you type. It uses various tools and techniques to analyze your code quality and performance, such as Data Flow Analysis, Clangd-based checks, Clang-Tidy[^2^], and more. Here are some examples of how CLion 2019.1 can help you create code that's beautiful and correct:

- Unused Code Detection: CLion 2019.1 can highlight unused and unreachable code in your project, so you can remove it or comment it out.
- Dangling Pointer Detection: CLion 2019.1 can warn you about possible dangling pointers in your code, so you can avoid memory leaks and crashes.
- Type Cast Detection: CLion 2019.1 can detect missing or redundant type casts in your code, so you can improve its readability and safety.
- Function Overload Detection: CLion 2019.1 can detect cases where there is no matching function overload for a given call expression, so you can fix it or create a new overload.
- Code Fixes: CLion 2019.1 can provide quick-fixes for many common code issues, such as adding missing includes, changing variable types, adding default cases to switch statements, and more.

## Integrated Debugger
 
A third essential feature of any IDE is the debugger. CLion 2019.1 provides an integrated debugger that supports GDB or LLDB as the backend. It allows you to investigate and solve problems with ease in your C and C++ code. You can attach to local processes or debug remotely. You can also use OpenOCD and Embedded GDB Server configurations to do on-chip debugging for embedded development[^2^]. Here are some examples of how CLion 2019.1 can help you debug your code efficiently:

- Breakpoints: CLion 2019.1 allows you to set breakpoints in your code, with various options such as conditions, expressions, hit counts, log messages, actions, etc.
- Watches: CLion 2019.1 allows you to watch any expression or variable in your code during debugging sessions, with various options 8cf37b1e13
