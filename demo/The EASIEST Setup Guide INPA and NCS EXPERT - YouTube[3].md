# How to Install and Activate BMW INPA Software with Keygen
 
BMW INPA is a powerful diagnostic software that allows you to access various modules and functions of your BMW car. You can read and clear fault codes, perform coding and programming, reset service intervals, and more. However, to use BMW INPA, you need to install it correctly and activate it with a keygen.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install and activate BMW INPA software with keygen on Windows 10. We will use the BimmerGeeks Standard Tools package, which includes INPA, EDIABAS, NCS Expert, and other useful tools. We will also use the INPA K+DCAN USB interface cable, which is compatible with most BMW models from 1998 to 2008.
